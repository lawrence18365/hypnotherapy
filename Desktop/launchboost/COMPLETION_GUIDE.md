## 🔧 **MANUAL TASKS REQUIRED**

### **TASK 1: DATABASE MIGRATIONS** (Priority: CRITICAL)

Run these SQL files in your Supabase dashboard:

1. **Update payments table:**
```bash
# File: update_payments_table.sql
# Adds used_for_deal_id column for payment tracking
```

2. **Add performance indexes:**
```bash  
# File: add_performance_indexes.sql
# Adds all missing indexes for better performance
```

**How to execute:**
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard > SQL Editor
2. Copy content from `update_payments_table.sql`
3. Run the query
4. Copy content from `add_performance_indexes.sql` 
5. Run the query

### **TASK 2: EMAIL SERVICE SETUP** (Priority: HIGH)

**Install Resend:**
```bash
npm install resend
```

**Set up environment variables in `.env.local`:**
```env
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key_here
FROM_EMAIL=noreply@yourdomain.com
```

**Get Resend API Key:**
1. Go to https://resend.com
2. Sign up/Login
3. Go to API Keys → Create API Key
4. Copy the key to your `.env.local`

**Update newsletter API:**
```typescript
// Add to src/app/api/newsletter/subscribe/route.ts
import { Resend } from 'resend'

const resend = new Resend(process.env.RESEND_API_KEY)

// Replace the TODO comment with:
try {
  await resend.emails.send({
    from: process.env.FROM_EMAIL || 'noreply@launchboost.co',
    to: email,
    subject: 'Welcome to LaunchBoost!',
    html: `
      <h1>Welcome to LaunchBoost!</h1>
      <p>Thanks for subscribing to our newsletter. You'll be the first to know about the best SaaS deals!</p>
    `
  })
} catch (emailError) {
  // Email failed but subscription succeeded
  console.error('Failed to send welcome email:', emailError)
}
```

---

### **TASK 3: STRIPE WEBHOOK TESTING** (Priority: HIGH)

**Test webhook locally:**
```bash
# Install Stripe CLI
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3000/api/webhooks/stripe

# In another terminal, trigger a test event:
stripe trigger payment_intent.succeeded
```

**Check webhook endpoint responds correctly:**
1. Monitor your local logs for webhook hits
2. Verify payment status updates in database
3. Test both success and failure scenarios

---

### **TASK 4: LEGAL DOCUMENTS UPDATE** (Priority: MEDIUM)

**Files to update:**
- `src/app/(marketing)/terms/page.tsx`
- `src/app/(marketing)/privacy/page.tsx`

**What to include:**
- Real terms of service
- GDPR-compliant privacy policy  
- Payment terms and refund policy
- User data handling procedures

**Recommendation:** Use a legal template service like:
- Termly.com
- TermsFeed.com
- Or consult with a lawyer

### **TASK 5: ERROR MONITORING SETUP** (Priority: HIGH)

**Option A: Sentry (Recommended)**
```bash
npm install @sentry/nextjs
npx @sentry/wizard@latest -i nextjs
```

**Option B: LogRocket**
```bash
npm install logrocket
npm install logrocket-react
```

**Add to your layout.tsx:**
```typescript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nextjs"

if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
  Sentry.init({
    dsn: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN
  })
}
```

---

### **TASK 6: ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES** (Priority: CRITICAL)

**Verify these are set in production:**
```env
# Database
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=

# Payments  
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=

# Email
RESEND_API_KEY=
FROM_EMAIL=

# Monitoring (if using Sentry)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN=

# Security
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_random_secret_here
```
