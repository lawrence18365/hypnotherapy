### 🔧 **IN PROGRESS: FOUNDER DISCOUNT CODE COLLECTION SYSTEM**
**Focus**: Transform deal submission to collect founder's actual discount codes
**Date**: July 9, 2025 - Complete Deal Directory Implementation
**Business Model Clarification**: LaunchBoost is a DEAL DIRECTORY where:

✅ Updated .env.local template with proper CLOUDFLARE_R2_PUBLIC_URL format
✅ Added comments explaining public access requirement
